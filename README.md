<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You should have knowledge of how to install/set up and use the previous software and libraries described in <a href="#built-with">Built With</a> section, and have already a database with the tables described in the documentation folder.

### Prerequisites

* You have already created the required tables in your relational database server described in "Documentacion" folder (MYSQL/POSTGRESQL)

### Installation

1. Install PHP in your server
2. Clone the repository
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/ANVRRT/CCLaModerna.git
  ```
3. Modify the "dbh.inc.php" file located in "CCLaModerna/includes/dbh.inc.php" to set up the conection to your SQL server modifying lines 3, 4, 5, and 6 with your SQL credentials
<ul>
  <li>3 - $serverName
  <li>4 - $dBUsername
  <li>5 - $dBPassword
  <li>6 - $dBname
</ul>
  
4. Create a new company with name "SYS" and "idCompania" = "SYS" in the table "Compania", and the roles in table "Rol"
   ```MYSQL
   INSERT INTO Compania VALUES("SYS","SYS",1,null);
   INSERT INTO Rol VALUES("SYS","ADM");
   ```
5. Deploy your site
6. Once deployed, go to yoursite/php/register.php and create a new user filling up the form with your "idCompania" = "SYS" and "rol" = "ADM" <br><br><br>

8. Keep in mind that this are the unique roles set up in the system, and the roles permissions can't be set dynamically in the system (Without touching the code) but the user permissions can.   This are the roles that are set ADM, DIR, FAC, CXC, VTA, CST, ING, PLN, FEC and need to be added into your SQL table "Rol".
